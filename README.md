# basestats
Statistics about your codebase (only PHP for now)

What it's eventually going to be
* Electron App
* Search engine so you can search through all files in your codebase
* Parser, so it'll parse your entire codebase and get stats about every file
  * how many times a function is used
  * how many functions the class has
  * most used functions/methods
  * file dependencies
  * file dependants
  * ... I'll probably come up with more while making it
* Simple, minimalistic yet detailed design
* Graphs
* Numbers
* Pretty icons
* Each class has a fancy (simple) image based on their name, all unique, _something like the image at the bottom_.
